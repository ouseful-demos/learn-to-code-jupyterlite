This week you have learned how to: 

* load a dataset into a dataframe from a CSV file

* clean data

* use the data to get answers to your questions.

Next week you will learn about the techniques behind the creation of a combined dataset. 

You are now halfway through the course. The Open University would really appreciate your feedback and suggestions for future improvement in our optional [end-of-course survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BOCENDlearntocode), which you will also have an opportunity to complete at the end of Week 8. Participation will be completely confidential and we will not pass on your details to others.
